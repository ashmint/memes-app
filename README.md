## Optimizations


This program works, however in the future it would be great to:

-use gif memes

-have a collaborated collection of memes 


---
## Lessons Learned:

- learned the importance of code optimization. Optimizing the code improved the performance of the application, resulting in faster loading times and improved user experience.
